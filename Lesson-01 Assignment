1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;
Ans: use Github for share codes and experiences. 
Jupyter is better for coach and demenstration and small program; Pycharm is better for bigger or complex coding

2. What's the Probability Model?
Ans: a Probability Model is a statistical model to describe the probability of sth, concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population).

3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?
Ans: gamble, insurance

4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?
Ans: In NLP, we use probability to solve the difficulties of programming based on parsing and pattern match.
The difficulties of programming based on parsing and pattern match are: natural language process in computer may be too complex to analyze in parsing and pattern match, especially in complex situations.

5. What's the Language Model;
Ans: the probability of a sentance based on mass sentance data

6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?
Ans: to differentiate the ambiguous language from voice recognition 

7. What's the 1-gram language model;
Ans: combine the probability of single word of sentences separately.

8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;
Ans: disadv: the connections of words are not considered and so the probability of low in complex situation; 
adv:it is faster in running speed, and maybe useful for very targeted simple situaiton

9. What't the 2-gram models;
Ans: combine the probability of both separate single word and adjacent 2 words
